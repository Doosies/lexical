<p>
  Lexical is an extensible JavaScript web text-editor framework with an emphasis
  on reliability, accessibility, and performance. Lexical aims to provide a
  best-in-class developer experience, so you can easily prototype and build
  features with confidence. Combined with a highly extensible architecture,
  Lexical allows developers to create unique text editing experiences that scale
  in size and functionality. The core of Lexical is a dependency-free text
  editor engine that allows for powerful, simple and complex, editor
  implementations to be built on top. Lexical&#39;s engine provides three main
  parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    editor instances that each attach to a single content editable element.
  </li>
  <li>
    a set of editor states that represent the current and pending states of the
    editor at any given time.
  </li>
  <li>
    a DOM reconciler that takes a set of editor states, diffs the changes, and
    updates the DOM according to their state. By design, the core of Lexical
    tries to be as minimal as possible. Lexical doesn&#39;t directly concern
    itself with things that monolithic editors tend to do – such as UI
    components, toolbars or rich-text features and markdown. Instead the logic
    for those features can be included via a plugin interface and used as and
    when they&#39;re needed. This ensures great extensibility and keeps
    code-sizes to a minimum – ensuring apps only pay the cost for what they
    actually import. For React apps, Lexical has tight integration with React
    18+ via the optional @lexical/react package. This package provides
    production-ready utility functions, helpers and React hooks that make it
    seamless to create text editors within React.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="usage">Usage</h4>
<p>
  The lexical package contains only the core Lexical engine and nodes. This
  package is intended to be used in conjunction with packages that wire Lexical
  up to applications, such as @lexical/react .
</p>
<h4 id="working-with-lexical">Working with Lexical</h4>
<p>
  This section covers how to use Lexical, independently of any framework or
  library. For those intending to use Lexical in their React applications,
  it&#39;s advisable to check out the source-code for the hooks that are shipped
  in @lexical/react.
</p>
<h5 id="creating-an-editor-and-using-it">Creating an editor and using it</h5>
<p>
  When you work with Lexical, you normally work with a single editor instance.
  An editor instance can be thought of as the one responsible for wiring up an
  EditorState with the DOM. The editor is also the place where you can register
  custom nodes, add listeners, and transforms. An editor instance can be created
  from the lexical package and accepts an optional configuration object that
  allows for theming and other options: import { createEditor } from
  &#39;lexical&#39; ; const config = { namespace : &#39;MyEditor&#39; , theme :
  { ... } , } ; const editor = createEditor ( config ) ;
</p>
<p>
  Once you have an editor instance, when ready, you can associate the editor
  instance with a content editable
</p>
<div>
  element in your document: const contentEditableElement = document .
  getElementById ( &#39;editor&#39; ) ; editor . setRootElement (
  contentEditableElement ) ;
  <p></p>
  <p>
    If you want to clear the editor instance from the element, you can pass null
    . Alternatively, you can switch to another element if need be, just pass an
    alternative element reference to setRootElement() .
  </p>
  <h5 id="understanding-the-editor-state">Understanding the Editor State</h5>
  <p>
    With Lexical, the source of truth is not the DOM, but rather an underlying
    state model that Lexical maintains and associates with an editor instance.
    You can get the latest editor state from an editor by calling
    editor.getEditorState() . Editor states have two phases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      During an update they can be thought of as &#34;mutable&#34;. See
      &#34;Updating an editor&#34; below to mutate an editor state.
    </li>
    <li>
      After an update, the editor state is then locked and deemed immutable from
      there one. This editor state can therefore be thought of as a
      &#34;snapshot&#34;. Editor states contain two core things:
    </li>
    <li>The editor node tree (starting from the root node).</li>
    <li>
      The editor selection (which can be null). Editor states are serializable
      to JSON, and the editor instance provides a useful method to deserialize
      stringified editor states. const stringifiedEditorState = JSON . stringify
      ( editor . getEditorState ( ) . toJSON ( ) ) ; const newEditorState =
      editor . parseEditorState ( stringifiedEditorState ) ;
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="updating-an-editor">Updating an editor</h5>
  <p>There are a few ways to update an editor instance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trigger an update with editor.update()</li>
    <li>Setting the editor state via editor.setEditorState()</li>
    <li>
      Applying a change as part of an existing update via
      editor.registerNodeTransform()
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a command listener with editor.registerCommand(EXAMPLE_COMMAND, ()
      =&gt; {...}, priority) The most common way to update the editor is to use
      editor.update() . Calling this function requires a function to be passed
      in that will provide access to mutate the underlying editor state. When
      starting a fresh update, the current editor state is cloned and used as
      the starting point. From a technical perspective, this means that Lexical
      leverages a technique called double-buffering during updates. There&#39;s
      an editor state to represent what is current on the screen, and another
      work-in-progress editor state that represents future changes. Creating an
      update is typically an async process that allows Lexical to batch multiple
      updates together in a single update – improving performance. When Lexical
      is ready to commit the update to the DOM, the underlying mutations and
      changes in the update will form a new immutable editor state. Calling
      editor.getEditorState() will then return the latest editor state based on
      the changes from the update. Here&#39;s an example of how you can update
      an editor instance: import { $getRoot , $getSelection } from
      &#39;lexical&#39; ; import { $createParagraphNode } from
      &#39;lexical/PargraphNode&#39; ; // Inside the
      <code>editor.update</code>
      you can use special $ prefixed helper functions. // These functions cannot
      be used outside the closure, and will error if you try. // (If you&#39;re
      familiar with React, you can imagine these to be a bit like using a hook
      // outside of a React function component). editor . update ( ( ) =&gt; {
      // Get the RootNode from the EditorState const root = $getRoot ( ) ; //
      Get the selection from the EditorState const selection = $getSelection ( )
      ; // Create a new ParagraphNode const paragraphNode = $createParagraphNode
      ( ) ; // Create a new TextNode const textNode = $createTextNode (
      &#39;Hello world&#39; ) ; // Append the text node to the paragraph
      paragraphNode . append ( textNode ) ; // Finally, append the paragraph to
      the root root . append ( paragraphNode ) ; } ) ;
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you want to know when the editor updates so you can react to the changes,
    you can add an update listener to the editor, as shown below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      editor . registerUpdateListener ( ( { editorState } ) =&gt; { // The
      latest EditorState can be found as
      <code>editorState</code>
      . // To read the contents of the EditorState, use the following API:
      editorState . read ( ( ) =&gt; { // Just like editor.update(), .read()
      expects a closure where you can use // the $ prefixed helper functions. }
      ) ; } ) ; Usage
    </li>
