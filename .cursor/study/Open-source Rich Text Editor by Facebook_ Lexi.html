<p>
  in this video I&#39;m going to walk you through how to set up lexic call it is
  the tech editor that is created by Facebook and this is what it look like you
  can go into the playground I leave the link in description to see what
  it&#39;s like and it&#39;s really nice it has a lot of functionality that you
  can use for your Rich Tech editor so right now let&#39;s try to set it up so
  to set it up you can go into the documentation and click on get started so uh
  in this video I&#39;m going to show you how to set up inside your react CHS
  project and also if you wanted to use used with vanilla JS there have also a
  get started on how to do it as well so this is like the documentation okay so
  for the react you can go into react right here and then go into introduction
  and get um started so inside this documentation there&#39;s a video tutorial
  on show you how to do it as well and also there&#39;s like a codes that you
  can run and see the project and this is like the code right here it is a lot
  of codes from this one but what I&#39;m going to do in this video is just try
  to break it down all this code and try to set it up from scratch and you can
  when you come back and see all of the code right here you will be a little bit
  better understanding of what it does right here all right so I&#39;m going to
  try to reference and copy and paste from this code right here all right okay
  so right now what we&#39;re going to do first we going to install this to
  library with this right herey inside your react project which I already did I
  already installed this one so this is my next year&#39;s project and so the
  next step that we going to do is just copy and paste this one so I&#39;m going
  to copy and paste this one let&#39;s go back inside the editor I have my
  editor component right here so I&#39;m going to just copy and paste this one
  so I have something ritten before I&#39;m going to remove this one and this is
  going to be a client component so we can use the use client and then if you
  are using with pure react project you don&#39;t have to this is just uh
  because I&#39;m using with nextjs and I&#39;m going to cast The Arrow this one
  to uh any because I do not know the type of it and then for the editor right
  here I think we need to do export and then do default right here so export
  default this function and I I&#39;m going to wrap around the style of this one
  so right here so maybe uh let me show you what it&#39;s like first so right
  now so U this is what we just copy and paste and inside the page I have this
  one import inside my page right here okay great so right now if we go back so
  if we refresh so this is what it look like it&#39;s just blank it&#39;s
  nothing&#39;s going on it&#39;s not looking really good so I prepared the
  Styles before so I&#39;m going to convert it to something like this so first I
  just adding like the background slate and then it&#39;s now it looks something
  like this and then if we go back to editor I&#39;m going to undo what I have
  written here and then we can just do this one and right now you can see right
  now it&#39;s look a lot better and then for the content editable right here
  which which is this one we can do another one which is going to set the focus
  on this one to outline to none and then right now it looks something like this
  which is really nice okay so when you type something right here it&#39;s it
  work really well okay so right now uh the next things that I&#39;m going to do
  is try to explain you what this one does so the is if you look at the code
  right here so we have the lexical composer that inside this composer we can
  put a lot of plugin so as you can see we have the rich text plugins and we
  have history plugin the autofocus plugin and if you want to learn more about
  those plugin you can go into this plugin right here and and for the lexical
  composer right here you can think of it like the react context and then so
  whatever component that you put between it inside it you can access to the
  lexical composer uh like uh the editor object so this is uh really nice when
  you use it for the create the toolbar and things like that which we will going
  to do it later okay so inside here we have the initial com uh config we have
  the Nam space so the namespace right here you can name this whatever you want
  and we have the seams so right now it&#39;s empty and then also we have the on
  Arrow function right here that&#39;s going to catch an arrow so right now
  let&#39;s take a look at the seam what is this seams so the seam here is
  really important on how you going to style your uh Tech editor and what
  it&#39;s going to look like so let&#39;s go into this one the seaming and this
  is what it look this is what it look like and I&#39;m going to scroll to the
  example theme right here so I&#39;m going to just copy and paste this one just
  copy this then I&#39;m going to paste it right here and then we going to use
  it right here so instead of the seam I&#39;m going to past it right here and
  then we can remove this one so right now if we go to our Tech editor
  there&#39;s nothing change so when we type there&#39;s nothing&#39;s going on
  but for this same is responsible is how you&#39;re going to style your editor
  so for example inside our editor is going to have paragraph it&#39;s going to
  have the heading and things like that right inside the theme so as you can see
  we have the paragraph We have the heading we have a list we have the image we
  have like whatever text we have here so for example the paragraph right here
  we have the value edit the paragraph So this value is is referent to the class
  name it&#39;s is going to be referent if you write your own CSS this is going
  to be your class uh CSS class but if you going to write it with twin so
  it&#39;s going to be like for example it text blue 500 you can do whatever you
  want inside here for example text to XL and things like that right now we
  refresh this one if we type again so you can see this is Tex XL and then text
  blue 500 so this is like how you&#39;re going to style it for example and the
  uh heading you can just change the heading so this is uh how you going to
  style the element inside your Tech editor great so this is on like how to set
  it up so the next step that we going to do is to create the plugins that uh
  the toolbar so for example when we click on bowl and this thing is going to be
  bowl and things like that all right so for that we need to create the
  component right here it&#39;s going to be toolbars. TSX and then we can run
  this one this toolbar inside this toolbar we can access to editor um the
  objects which is we can use the lexical composer contacts and then inside here
  you can access to editor this one right here great and right now when when you
  use this component make sure it&#39;s between the lexical comp uh composer if
  you use it outside like this it&#39;s not going to work right now we can put
  the the toolbar inside this one and we go back go this one so we have our
  toolbar so right now let&#39;s try to do like Bowl so for example I&#39;m
  going to create the Bon that responsible for bowl and so we can do something
  like this so when the this onclick the bow onclick what we can do we can do
  the editor dot dis patch command and the command right here what it does is
  going to format our text to be bold and things like that right so lexic call
  has its buil-in for you you can just do like the format text Command right
  here and this is the value that you want to format so you want to format to
  code to bowl to italic and things like that so right now we want it to be bowl
  and if you want it to be italic so for example uh this is going to be I right
  this is I and then we can do like this is format into italic great and maybe I
  think I can style this one to italic text as well if we go back right now we
  have the B and the I maybe we can have a little bit of spacings let&#39;s do
  space X of this one to three so it has a little bit of spacing great so right
  now when uh when we go in this one when I type po when I select and type pole
  so you can see right now our TCH is pole so it is uh it&#39;s working and then
  if we select the text again and then if I type on italic it&#39;s not going to
  italic so let&#39;s see why it&#39;s not working so I think uh for this one
  you need to go into the theme that you set up and then you can try to change
  this one right here so for example the italic right key you can change this
  one is going to be italic so this is going to be the CSS uh this is going to
  be theal win class for italic I&#39;m not sure like B why it work as well
  maybe if I refresh and do it again I think it&#39;s not going to work oh it
  still work maybe it&#39;s convert this one to strong which is strong as po as
  well but for italic since we change right now if we click on it again so you
  can see it is become italic right now and for Bowl maybe I can go to set up
  this font bowl and for the paragraph right here I&#39;m not going to do
  anything so I&#39;m just leave this blank and the color should be uh inherit
  so you can see right now we can say hello world and then if we want to Bow we
  can click on bow it&#39;s bow nice and everything is bold right now and then
  if I want this part to be italic and it&#39;s become metallic great so right
  now the next step I think for these to bu is not working functional properly
  we want it to like you know see okay when it&#39;s bold we know that okay
  it&#39;s bold and things like that and for that we can take a look at this
  code and so for this one so first we can create like a state to check if it is
  B of it is tallic so I can copy and paste this code right here and go to
  toolbar and so we can have this one so let&#39;s try to set this one right
  here and right here we they going to use the hook right here so they we going
  to create this update tool bar we can just copy and paste this one this update
  tool bar it&#39;s going to up uh import the use callback use get select right
  here and then we have the is range select as well and then I&#39;m going to
  remove this one so because we&#39;re going to focus on is Bow and is telic
  only so what this function is responsible is something like that so something
  like this so for example if you select this one if it&#39;s B it will show you
  that okay this is B and if it&#39;s italic it&#39;s going to show you if
  it&#39;s italic so whenever you do the movement inside this one right here and
  so when we have this function to use this one you can go into uh this use
  effect right here there&#39;s a lot of use effects maybe we can just copy
  everything and I&#39;m going to remove the unnecessary things right here so
  I&#39;m just going to do this one right here I think for merge right here we
  done really need it right now maybe we can remove it and we can come back and
  use it later and it look like I&#39;m missing something things maybe which is
  this one right here uh let&#39;s see the editor and then I&#39;m not sure
  which one I&#39;m missing okay let try to run it back this one okay all right
  I see so right now we can have this one and when we remove the merge and this
  should work so I just need to import this one from react and this is all good
  so this one the editor right here just listens this uh updates and our Tech
  editor so whenever we run on this one when we type on this one this is going
  to run and when it&#39;s run uh we going to do the edictor do read and then we
  call this function so this function what is responsible we going to do like
  okay if this path that user on is bold or italic and things like that it&#39;s
  going to set this one since right now we have this like Boolean value right
  here we can use this value to uh you know update our state to look it&#39;s
  more a lot better so for example I me inside this class name right here we can
  do is to update this one to look a lot better I&#39;m going to give the side
  of this one to let&#39;s say eight and BG let&#39;s say if it is B is B we
  going to do BG gray 200 all right then we&#39;re going to do this one right
  now as you can see it&#39;s B and maybe I think for this one I get to make it
  better we can do round it this one to MD as well nice so if we click again
  this is not bowl and if you click it&#39;s bow and then for example if I right
  now it&#39;s click to unbow this one but if I click on this one because this
  part right here is B right so right right now that&#39;s why it&#39;s B and if
  I click undo this one it&#39;s I select this one it&#39;s not B if I click on
  this one again so you can see it work really nice and so we can do the same
  things for the uh italic right here right now let&#39;s do is italic uh italic
  and then for this one is going to be is italic right here and right now so if
  I hover on one of italic it&#39;s so you can see it&#39;s italic so for
  example if we select on this one if I convert this one to bowl everything is
  bowl and then if I convert this one to italic so it&#39;s italic and then yeah
  so I guess this is it uh it&#39;s really nice it working really great so this
  is how you create like a toolbar nice um so right now you know what uh this is
  what it&#39;s do right here you can go into the documentation like the code
  right here so you now you understand what it does so it&#39;s a lot better for
  me to go like through to show you like the whole things right here uh if you
  do not know like where I get this one it is from the this one right here this
  like run the project it&#39;s from stack blate you can just click here it will
  open nice so let&#39;s see what we do next I think one thing that the the
  example here did not show you is the heading so the heading is like for
  example if you can want to convert the text to H1 H2 and things like that and
  to do that is a little bit different and to do it so I&#39;m going to create
  another this one it is going to be the uh H1 so for example this is going when
  you click it&#39;s going to do the H1 and maybe let&#39;s try to keep the same
  style of this one let&#39;s try to remove this one okay so for the unclick on
  this one so for heading we going I&#39;m going to create another function this
  is going to be handle heading and so for this one I&#39;m going to do what we
  need to do is just go to editor do update and then we going to have the arrow
  function right here so what we want to update is let&#39;s say all right so
  right now the user select this one they want to convert this selection into
  the heading which is like for example H1 or H2 or H3 whatever they wanted to
  update okay right now what they need to do is just going to um get the
  selection so I&#39;m going to have the selection is equal to the selection
  this is the same thing that we do right here we have the selection right here
  after we have this selection and then we going to check if I think it&#39;s
  the same style as this one great all right and the next step that we going to
  do is to uh set the block but this one is going to from the another Library
  which is the uh lexical selection so we need to install another Library which
  is lexic call SL selections and I think this one right here yeah this one and
  then we need to run the PN PMI this one right here okay so while it&#39;s
  installing we can use it so this one is what we do is going to do use the set
  block type and this one right here and then we pass the selection that we
  select and we going to create the uh heading notes all right so we&#39;re
  going to do this one this is create the heading Noe so the creating heading
  note is one is need to install from the other Library which is lexic call Rich
  editor the rich text right here so you need to install another library and
  then we&#39;re going to do PN PMS I install this one again and then after
  it&#39;s complete we should be able to create heading notes this one and this
  is the value that you wanted to create so for example if you want to create an
  H1 you can put an H1 here if you want if you want to create an H2 you can put
  H2 so right now let&#39;s try to do put H1 and this one when it&#39;s called
  you can just call this function okay great so handle heading right now if we
  go back if we go here and I click nothing happened so the reason that is
  nothing happened is because we need to go into our editor we need to go our
  theme and then we need to update this one so what it&#39;s going to look like
  for our uh H1 so the tech let&#39;s say 3 XL fun is going to go into bowl and
  for this one right now let&#39;s try to refresh it and so you can do hello and
  then you can do select on this one you can do all right so right now it look
  like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not working okay I forgot one more thing that when
  we do that we need to add the notes into this one so the notes of this one it
  need to have the The Heading as well so we have to put the heading note um
  wait a moment I need to check the reference code right here yeah so this is
  going going to be the heading notes heading notes this is from the rich Tech
  editor right this one okay let&#39;s save this one and right now if we&#39;re
  going to do hello and we&#39;re going to do this one as you can see right now
  it&#39;s convert this one to the uh hello uh to the um heading and for this
  one is going to everything is going to be in heading right now it&#39;s going
  to be back to paragraph and for the heading if you wanted to italic it&#39;s
  going to be italic right here okay great so t how you convert this one uh and
  I think that is all maybe I think if you wanted to like create a custom this
  one you can do a loops and then off all the heading and then for example of
  the ball right here you can have like the head like the text and then you can
  do the you can pass the dynamic parameter right here because right now we had
  code AS at H1 so this is what you can do as well great uh I think that&#39;s
  all may be I think the undo command and the uh in undo Command right here that
  also exist inside here as well so basically you can just copy and paste this
  one so they can do command this this is the one uh the register so maybe we
  can do we need to return so we&#39;re going to merge register together so we
  going to do that so merge this one and then we can do uh this we can add more
  register command so for example the undo command let&#39;s see the undo
  Command right here and let&#39;s do this one right here so this is uh will
  import from lexol as well so this is going to be a state we can copy the state
  from the set can do or redo this one I&#39;m going to copy and paste this to
  right here great and for the merge register right here I think we need to
  install it from another Library which is this one so if you try to import this
  one it&#39;s going to it&#39;s not going to work so we need to install another
  library for this one as well the npm let&#39;s do I and then L lexical till
  right here okay I think for the low priority right here I&#39;m not really
  sure what it does so I&#39;m going to uh the value of this one is going to be
  one so I&#39;m going to put one right here and I think this is going to be the
  last two bar that I&#39;m going to work on which is the undo so we can do like
  put the undo right here uh if you look at the code of the undo which is the uh
  let&#39;s do this one and we can find the undo maybe the undo or redo okay so
  this one and I think we need to dispatch this one so you can see which is this
  one we can just copy and paste the whole things and this one and then we can
  just do the import this one great and so for this if we go back right now we
  should be able to maybe I can add have the TCH is like undo and we have the
  undo right here I think we can have like a disable so if this one is going to
  be text grare 100 maybe not 500 so it look something like this so but when we
  type on this one all right I think when we type that there should be like
  dispatch some event that we can undo or redo this one um it look like the
  merge right here is not working the merch oh because the merge register right
  here I merch re merge with redo so we can change this one to undo instead okay
  can undo command and then also this one we&#39;re going to need to set undo
  command can undo as well great so right now if I type so you can see it uh
  it&#39;s uh enable so when we click it&#39;s disable this one as well great so
  I think that&#39;s all maybe I think you can play around with this code right
  now you understand what&#39;s what everything here I think one uh more thing
  that I wanted to show you is how you&#39;re going to save this one so for
  example you can think of it is you work this one with the uh people so maybe
  when you type this one it&#39;s going to be auto save for you right so for
  that you can uh do the save within this one right here I believe inside here
  you can use another Library I think maybe use debound um so I think for this
  one you can use the library uh let me check on this one so use debound yes use
  de bounds oops use debound right here and I&#39;m going to install this one
  install this use debound PN PM I use D bound and inside here you can create
  like for example the function handle save okay and save this one and for the
  handle save right here we&#39;re going to use the use debound callback use
  debound callback and this one is going to pass the uh value which is going to
  be the content and then you can do whatever like the content right here so for
  example I&#39;m going as I&#39;m now I&#39;m going to save the console.log the
  content and right here you can pass to specify the value like this is like 5
  millisecond and the Hand all save right here will use it between the update
  listener right here and this one is we going to check on this one so this one
  we can access another object which is dirty element and another one is going
  to be dirty lift and this one we can check if dirt element is going to be
  equal to zero and the T lift uh do side is equal to zero as well okay all
  right look like we have some error right here maybe okay the elements. side as
  well so this one is just to check if there&#39;s no uh empty there&#39;s empty
  value or the value is not change so we not going to run uh the handle save so
  we can just call the handle save and the handle save right here can uh get the
  editor state which is the value right here can do Json stringify the editor
  State okay and right now if we go back into this one so we can go to the
  inspect on this one go to console.log and for example if I type this one right
  here so hello world so right now it&#39;s uh it&#39;s going to save so maybe
  if we do it again so you can see right now it&#39;s save right here as you can
  see uh this this is going to be delay like 5 milliseconds uh because we add
  specify here so we don&#39;t want to every key stroke right here we going to
  push and save it to the user so for example if I keep typing if I keep
  changing uh we are not doing anything but after I lift my keyboard and then 5
  millisecond later it&#39;s going to save it look like it&#39;s not maybe I
  need to refresh and do it again so let&#39;s say hello okay all right it it it
  looked like it&#39;s not working yeah it it look like it&#39;s not working
  maybe I can remove this one okay right now it&#39;s Save which it
  shouldn&#39;t right this one it it shouldn&#39;t ah for this one I think I I
  made the wrong mistake so this one should be returned my bad so if it&#39;s
  this one we can just return else we can save this one let&#39;s try to do it
  again so right now it&#39;s empty if I type this one but if I leave my
  keyboard 5 misec rater is save I type I keep typing that&#39;s not going to
  save and if I leave my keyboard it&#39;s safe so this one is store like this
  so in the database you can store like a string inside your database okay so
  this is what it look like um all right so right now uh one last things before
  we going to end this video is going to show you how to load the state so um
  let&#39;s try to do that so right here we&#39;re going to create another
  component called load State and we&#39;re going to run this one right here for
  load state right here we can access to the uh component which is this uh
  editor right here as well I&#39;m going to do this the same we can access to
  this and then we can make sure to call the load state in between the this one
  right here so let&#39;s do do it the load State and inside the load state
  right here you can for example in this one you can uh fetch the data from the
  database or fetch the data from the local storage and update your state so
  this is going to return empty you don&#39;t have to return anything so for
  example right here we can use the use effects that is I&#39;m going to try to
  simulate like okay we are fetching the data from the database and things like
  that and uh for this one what we need to do is just create the s of the new
  state of the editor state it is going to be equal to editor do path editor and
  then this is the value that you&#39;re going to pass in so for example uh I
  think let&#39;s try to refresh this one um let&#39;s try do this and right now
  let&#39;s try to type something and try to get the value so I&#39;m trying to
  get the value of this one and uh let&#39;s try to save it somewhere so this is
  like the fake value and maybe let&#39;s do the let&#39;s say t text right here
  it is going to be equal to this value so this one is going to pass the text
  value inside this one and after we get this new state what we need to do is
  just editor. set State um set State and then with the new state right here
  okay right now if we go back if we refresh and um wait for a moment and as you
  can see right now we have the state right here so which is really nice so this
  is when you fetch the data from the database and also while it&#39;s fetching
  um so maybe you can do one thing like for example so on initial load we&#39;re
  going to do like is editable so this one we can mark this one as a read only
  so we do editable I think editable is to F on the initial load so right now on
  the initial load it editable fall so right now you cannot edit but after
  it&#39;s load to State you can do the editor. editable I think we can set
  editable yeah it set editable to true all right so right now we do this one
  and then right now as you can see it&#39;s editable to true you can uh type
  and you can do whatever that you want to do before and so yeah I think
  that&#39;s all that I want to show you this is like not a complete um uh show
  like you know like how to use it with the project but you know this is a
  really good uh good started like if you wanted to use this one inside your
  project and hopefully that you are learning some things so all of the thing
  that I learned this one uh it&#39;s credit to the documentation so basically I
  just copy and paste here and also there&#39;s a video explaining on how to do
  it as well so you can see there&#39;s a video for example the two bar and
  heading so but uh it just for me just it&#39;s really hard to you know to
  watch um so maybe uh that&#39;s why I make another video for this one uh but
  anyway if you learn something or yeah uh let me know in the comments uh all of
  this thing is Creed to this videos and it&#39;s Creed to this documentation so
  I am not inventing something here I&#39;m just show you how to use it and yeah
  let me know if you have any comments uh comment down below if you still
  unclear or if you wanted me to like you know show you how to do something else
  with this one I try to learn how to do it and show it to you guys as well so
  thank you for watching and happy coding and see you in the next video
</p>
