  The easiest way to debug websites built with Lexical is to install the Lexical
  Developer Tools browser extension. It is available for several popular
  browsers: Now, if you visit a website built with Lexical (such as
  <a href="https://playground.lexical.dev/">https://playground.lexical.dev/</a>
  ), you will see the
  <em>Lexical</em>
  panel in your browser Inspector window.
