  Lexical is an extensible JavaScript web text-editor framework with an emphasis
  on reliability, accessibility, and performance. Lexical aims to provide a
  best-in-class developer experience, so you can easily prototype and build
  features with confidence. Combined with a highly extensible architecture,
  Lexical allows developers to create unique text editing experiences that scale
  in size and functionality. Lexical works by attaching itself to a
  contentEditable element and from there you can work with Lexical&#39;s
  declarative APIs to make things happen without needing to worry about specific
  edge-cases around the DOM. In fact, you rarely need to interact with the DOM
  at all in most cases (unless you build your own custom nodes). Modular
  architecture allows fine grained control over functionality The core package
  of Lexical is only 22kb in file size (min+gzip) and you only ever pay the cost
  for what you need. So Lexical can grow with your surface and the requirements.
  Furthermore, in frameworks that support lazy-loading, you can defer Lexical
  plugins until the user actually interacts with the editor itself â€“ which can
  greatly help improve performance.

  Lexical makes it possible to easily create complex text editing experiences
  that otherwise would be very complex with the built-in browser tooling. We
  built Lexical to enable developers to move-fast and create different types of
  text experiences that scale to specific requirements. Here are some (but not
  all) examples of what you can do with Lexical:
