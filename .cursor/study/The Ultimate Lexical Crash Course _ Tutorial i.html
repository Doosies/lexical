<p>
  hey everyone my name is usan and this video we will build a rich text editor
  using legle and by the end of this video we will surely Master it so make sure
  to subscribe to the Channel smash the like button and let&#39;s dive into it
  so here&#39;s the r text editor we will be building we can enter any text we
  want and then we can basically do different things like I can make it bold
  italic underline I can strike through it highlight it Etc also I can make it a
  superscript subscript show it in a coded format align it to the center right
  or left and then basically undo and redo all the actions I just performed also
  I can apply any heading formatting so you know from H1 to H6 I can apply any
  heading formatting and you can see that it formats it also if I want to save
  the r text editor state to the server I can click on the save button it would
  save it and if I refresh it you will see that loads it from the server so the
  data doesn&#39;t get lost it persists and we will Implement all these features
  in this video so let&#39;s remove all the code and build the from the ground
  up so in order to get started you have to install two dependencies legal and
  legal direct because we will use legal inside direct after that let&#39;s
  start importing stuff and start building the red text editor so I&#39;ve got a
  red text editor component here and I am rendering it in the app component so
  basically let&#39;s add the lexical code here so first I will add a box which
  is thetive in Chakra UI you can use any library to make the custom components
  you will have like the toolbar and everything but I&#39;m us using Sak UA
  because I like it first thing we&#39;ll add is the legle composer so I will
  import it from legle react lexical composer and this is basically the rapper
  for everything legal related and it works as a context provider so if you know
  about re context basically so inside this lexical composer component you will
  be able to add any plug-in anything you want and it would work and basically
  you will be able to extract the editor instance in any component and uh this r
  everything which is legal related so I will add this component legal composer
  now this legal composer has an initial config prop so I will add it initial
  config should be let me make it here initial config is equal to so it has some
  required properties let me add it here so first is namespace so namespace is
  basically the name of this sidor just like if you have multiple Fields you can
  give different names to this and that basically differentiates those two
  Fields so name space is basically you know just like a name for the D Tex
  editor so I can give it name like Rich Text Editor one for now I&#39;ll make
  it Dynamic later then the next property would be theme so right now I will
  only add an empty object for the theme and we would come back to it later and
  then the on error so I will add an empty function for now so these are the
  three required properties you can see that the error goes away and here I will
  will add the nodes property so nodes is basically if you are using some custom
  functionality in lexical then you need to pass the related nodes in the nodes
  array so for this particular Rich Text Editor which I will Implement I added
  the ability of formatting the text in the form of headings also you could
  format the text in the form of code blocks so for that I will add the
  respective nodes here so I will import The Heading node from lexical Rich text
  and I will add it here and then from lexical code I will import some other
  nodes as well so legal code I will import the code highlight node and the code
  node let me copy these and I will add them here so these are basically the
  nodes related to the functionality which I will Implement if you&#39;re going
  to implement some other functionalities like adding tables adding list Etc
  then you will basically import those nodes from the respective packages and
  then add them here otherwise those functionalities won&#39;t work even if you
  implement them by following the docs so this is important now if you go here
  you can see that it still doesn&#39;t render anything so basically this is the
  config or the base for the lexical project we still need to you know add the r
  accelator Etc so the way legle works is this is the legic composer inside this
  we will have different plugins so some are built in plugins some are plugins
  which we will add ourselves you know custom plugins so first of all I will add
  a plugin which is you know built in so I will import the RX plugin from
  lexical react lexical R Tex plugin and this is basically the main thing the
  portion we will write on stuff so this component has some additional props so
  one is content editable so I will import content editable we have to pass a
  component here so this should be legal content editable and there I would get
  the content editable component and there I have to pass it inside this prop so
  content editable now this component also requires some other props like
  placeholder error boundary so let me add those so placeholder for now I will
  just add some dummy text here and here in the error boundary I will import the
  lexical error boundary so lexical error boundary lexical error boundary and
  this would go here now if I go to Local Host I see some text which is
  basically the placeholder but I don&#39;t see any place for writing content so
  basically I will have to style the content ID table give it a height or
  something so I&#39;ll add a class name then basically I will use a library
  emotion CSS to inject in line Styles so if you want to use normal CSS like you
  want that you add a CSS file and then you just add a glass here and then add
  the Styles in that particular CSS file that is okay as well your choice so
  here I&#39;ll say height should be 120 pixel then font size should be 12
  padding should be 8 overflow should be Auto so if I now come here you can see
  that if I click on it there is a text f type thing and you know I can add text
  and stuff uh which is great I also want to remove this Focus border because it
  is kind of ugly so I&#39;ll go here and I&#39;ll say outline should be none so
  now that outline is gone I also would want to add a border with a border
  radius for at least I can see it so I&#39;ll go here I&#39;ll say border
  should be 1 pixel solid black and then the Border radius should be 4 pixels
  great so now you can see that there&#39;s a border around great so the
  placeholder is not where it should be so we have to style the placeholder a
  bit so we&#39;ll absolutely position it based on the this text plugin we have
  so first all I&#39;ll wrap it with a box the box is just a div and chakra UI I
  will basically place it inside the box I will give a position relative to the
  box then here I will add another box and then I will give it a class name and
  some Styles so I&#39;ll say its position should be absolute its color should
  be slightly light grayish its top should be 8 pixel left should be 10 pixel
  and then font size should be 12 pixel now if I go here you can see that you
  know the placeholder kind of looks part of the text editor now which is great
  if I type anything the placeholder goes away and that is how it should work so
  you know we have successfully added the placeholder as well now just like the
  r Tex plugin legle also has some built-in plugins which can add some more
  functionality so for example there is also an autofocus plugin so if you want
  that whenever the r text plugin gets stred it has autofocus by default you can
  add the autofocus plugin so let&#39;s import that I copy this then here
  I&#39;ll say legal autofocus plugin and here I&#39;ll import autofocus plugin
  and you just have to add it inside the logical composer so I&#39;ll add it
  like this now if I refresh you can see that it has focus by default which is
  great if you want to add the functionality similarly there are tons of other
  plugins as well you can go to the legal documentation and you can check it out
  now I will like to add the toolbar because that is the main portion of the
  text editor and then basically I will add the on click handlers for those
  buttons and which would basically make the text bold underline Etc so I have
  already a tool by plugin component here but it is empty so I will add it above
  the r text plugins so toolbar plugin let me import it great now let me go to
  the toolbar plugin file di now it has got nothing it has just got a button
  group component which basically provides some styles for all the icon buttons
  I will render inside this nothing fancy now I have a constants file and in
  that coner file I already have an array created because I didn&#39;t want to
  waste time and first of all basically I have an enum so this enum has all the
  actions I would like to perform so bold Alex underline code left align right
  align undoo Etc So based on these rich text actions I have created an array so
  the array has objects which have IDs the icon which I will show in that icon
  button and the label so this is the area label if you want to add it and yeah
  so basically I will use this are to map out icon buttons and based on this ID
  I will basically decide what I want to do with the text I&#39;ve selected on
  click so that is what I want to do let&#39;s do that so I&#39;ll go to the
  toolbar plugin this text options so I inside this this button group I&#39;ll
  say Rich Text options. map and then I will get some options here let me return
  an icon button component here and here I will get ID label icon and font size
  so in the icon button I will add the label area label so area label would be
  the label then I icon would be icon then font size would be font size and then
  basically the on click function so on click function would be on action ID and
  here I will copy the on action function name and I will make an onaction
  function so the on action function would get an ID which would be Bri text
  action cool also within this array I have some dividers as well so basically I
  will use a divider component which is just a vertical line to separate some
  group of icons so here I&#39;ll say if the ID is equal to H text action.
  divider then render the divider component otherwise render the second mod so
  now we can see that the icon buttons have rendered and they have divided as
  well to separate the icons great now obviously right now if you click on the
  button nothing happens because the on action function is doing nothing but
  let&#39;s add the logic for the on action function so basically this on action
  function is getting the ID now I will add a switch case here and based on the
  ID I will basically implement the text formatting or whatever I want so I will
  add a switch case here ID case would be which text action. bold then break
  similarly I will add for other options as well so basically copy pasted this
  case statement for other options as well great now in order to do something
  with the editor we have to get the editor from the context so I will import
  that so I&#39;ll say import from lexical react lexical composer context and
  here I&#39;ll get the use lexical composer context and basically gives us the
  editor instance so const editor is equal to I&#39;ll just use the hook so
  basically this editor is the main thing in any component if you want to format
  something if you want to add event handlers anything you want this is the main
  thing so I&#39;ll get the editor and here I&#39;ll say editor do editor.
  dispatch command so basically how these formatting thing works we have to
  dispatch a command in Legacy they have basically added different event lists
  or something that if someone dispatches this command then basically this
  action should be performed etc etc so for any kind of formatting we want we
  have to dispatch a command now for formatting based options like if I want to
  format the text to make it bold italic underline superscript subscript Etc I
  have to use a certain command so the first parameter is the command name and
  the second param is what we want to do with the command so the command name
  for formatting the text is format text command and the second parem would be
  the payload for the formatex command so we want to format it but how do we
  want to format it so if I type an empty string you&#39;ll see the bunch of
  options I get so bold code highlight italic Etc so basically I&#39;ve can
  format my text with these options so for this option I&#39;ll say bold now if
  I type something I selected I click on Bold voil up it has been folded now
  basically I will add it for all the formatting options so basically these
  eight options are all formatting text options so I will go here and I will
  copy paste it so for italics it should be italic for underline it should be
  underline also it is typescript enabled so if you make a spelling mistake or
  something or you mistakenly add some other thing here it would give an error
  so don&#39;t worry so strike through for superscript it would be superscript
  for subscript it would be subscript for highlight it would be highlight for
  code it would be code great now I&#39;ve added the code for all the buttons
  but you will notice one thing if I select this and I click on italic it
  doesn&#39;t make it if I click on the underline button it doesn&#39;t make it
  underline why because the there are some things which happen by default for
  some reason but some formatting options don&#39;t work by default so we
  basically have to add those Styles in the theme so remember in the initial
  config we have a theme option so basically for these theme Styles we&#39;ll
  have to add those styles for these particular things in the theme so let&#39;s
  go there so I will go to the this text edor component here I will make a theme
  variable and the theme variable is of type edit the theme classes basically
  this would give us type completions and this should be the theme cool so
  basically for text formatting themes I will type text then basically you know
  it would be like bold again I&#39;m using CSS in JS Library emotion CSS you
  can create a CSS file import it and then they basically just add the class
  name here your choice so here I&#39;ll say CSS font weight should be bold then
  for underline I will say text decoration should be underline for strike
  through it would be strike through and then there is another option underline
  strike through so for that it would be under line and strike through sorry it
  is line through not strike through then for italic it would be font style
  italic now if I select the text and I click on italic underline you will see
  that you know all the necessary styles are playing great now there is one
  thing as well you have to add the theme for some styles to work but you also
  can use the theme to customize the styles for some so for the if I select this
  and I click on code you&#39;ll see that gives it a pinkish color and in most
  of the r text editors that is not how the code formatting looks like the code
  formatting looks like it has a grayish background and a light grayish border
  and you know that is how in most of the places the code formatting is and I
  want that type of code formatting so basically I can override it I can come
  here I can say code and then basically I can add my own Styles here so color
  should be black black padding should be two background should be gr so e e and
  the Border should be 1 pixel solid and then some dark G color CCC now if I
  refresh I type something and I click on the code button you&#39;ll see that it
  gives it the format I specified in the theme so this is a great way to
  override stuff similarly let&#39;s add the logic for these buttons so I will
  go to the toolbar plug-in file yeah so for left align right align Etc I&#39;m
  not formatting the text for these alignment options I have to pass a different
  command so basically it would be format element command and then for format
  element command obviously code doesn&#39;t make sense so if I add an empty
  string here you&#39;ll see that these are the options available so for left
  align I will obviously use left let me copy it and paste it so for right align
  it would be right for Center align it would be Center for justify line it
  would be justify great and now alignment would work as well so right alignment
  center alignment justify Etc everything is working good now similarly for undo
  and redo we have separate commands so I&#39;ll add it here for undo and redo
  we have undo command we will pass undefined here and then for redo we have
  redo command so different commands for undo and redo now I will notice that
  undo and redo are not working the reason is because in order for them to work
  we have to add a plugin in the legal composer just like we added the r text
  plugin at the autofocus plugin so let me add that so I will come to the thisx
  editor file and I will import the history plugin so here I&#39;ll say lexical
  history plugin history plugin let me copy it and add it here now if I add
  something and I click on undo it gets removed if I you know add different
  styling to it like you know various styling and I click on undo you can see
  that it goes one step back if I click on redo it basically goes one step
  forward Etc so undo and redo and working as well great now basically I want to
  add the functionality where initially undo and doo button should be disabled
  because obviously right now I haven&#39;t added anything so I shouldn&#39;t be
  able to undo a redo similarly I should only be able to redo when I undo some
  step that is when I should be able to redo and similarly if I undo all the way
  back redo should be disable and so on so forth so let&#39;s add the logic for
  that so basically I will have to add event handlers for this so legle has a
  own way of adding event handlers so I&#39;ll add a use effect great then I
  will say return merge register let me import it so I will import it from
  lexical utils then inside this SM resister function we can add different event
  listeners so in legal event listeners can be added by saying editor do
  register command and then we basically have to add the command name and then a
  function so here the command name would be can undo command and then here
  would be we would have function and I will return false and then I also have
  to pass a priority so I&#39;ll pass a priority so basically how register
  command works is I have a command here I have a event listener function and
  then I have a priority so I can have multiple register command functions or
  multiple event listeners for the same event and based on the priority they
  will be called so if you know right now low priority is one I can add 1 2 3 4
  5 any number I want so if there are two event listeners for the same command
  and one has a higher priority that function would be called first if in that
  particular function here in that particular event listener I return true
  basically then it would not propagate further and only that particular
  function would be called but if I return false then if there is some other
  function event listen as well with some low priority then that would be called
  as well but in the order of priority so right now I have only got one function
  so you know it doesn&#39;t matter so here I will get the payload so I will
  create a state so this payload will basically tell me if I can undo or not
  similarly let me copy it place a comma here and then and basically here
  I&#39;ll say can redo command so basically this payload param in this function
  would tell me if I can undo here basically it would tell me if I can redo so
  anytime some change happens in the r text editor these functions would be
  called and basically I will update the state and based on that state I will
  disable the buttons so I&#39;ll say disable map set disable map is equal to
  use State and this would be an object where it would say Rich Text action dot
  undo true initially obviously it should be disabled and then for redo as well
  it should be true and then I will basically pass the disable map here so is
  disable abled should be disable map then I&#39;ll pass the ID here I&#39;ll
  have to specify its type so I&#39;ll say ID should be string value should be
  bul so now the error goes away and here I&#39;ll update the state for the
  disable map so PR disable map and then I&#39;ll spread it and then here it I
  would say undo should be equal to payload let me copy this here I will update
  the disabled state for redo great here I have to invert these because this is
  the can undo command and can redo command and we have to disable them based on
  those so I will invert them now initially you can see that these are disabled
  great if I type something you can see that undo gets enabled if I click on
  enable the redo gets enabled Etc so now this works great now let&#39;s say I
  add some text like this you know and I click on Bard now you can see that it
  does get formatted but when I select it I don&#39;t really know which
  particular formattings are active because you know there is no highlighting
  done on these buttons so I don&#39;t really know if this particular text which
  I have selected is currently bold or italic or underline I can you know guess
  based on formatting it is but still these buttons should be highlighted based
  on the text I select so if I select select this text then these three buttons
  should be highlighted because these three formats have currently been applied
  on this selected text so let&#39;s add the logic for that so within this merg
  register function I will add two more event handlers and basically I will do
  that particular functionality there so first of all I will copy this and
  I&#39;ll paste it here here I will add selection change command so whenever I
  select something basically this particular event handler would be called and I
  can basically you know do stuff here so I will call an update toolbar function
  here let me Define update toolbar function here similarly I need to add
  another event handler type thing so uh here I will say editor do update
  register update listener from here we will get the editor State inside it we
  will do editor state. read and inside this function we will call this update
  toolbar function again now inside this update toolbar function I want to get
  the particular text which is selected so I will say cons selection is equal to
  dollar sign get selection so I will import it from lexical then I&#39;ll say
  if is is range selection this is check which we need to add so if it is range
  selection then I want to basically update a state which I will Define right
  now so as of right now this would be like an empty object and it type would be
  the same but this would be selection map set selection map right and here
  I&#39;ll make a variable here so con new select ction map is equal to H text
  action. bold so selection. has format bold so basically this has format will
  tell us if that particular format has been applied on the selected text so I
  will basically you know copy paste it several times so for italics it would be
  italic for underline it would be underline and similarly for other stuff so
  strike through here I would write strike through for superscript it would be
  superscript and so on so forth so the same formatted options which we pass in
  case of editor do dispatch function click on on the buttons the same formatted
  options can be passed here and we can know if that particular format has been
  applied or not so the last one would be code code this should be Capital code
  also highlight one last thing highlight cool so I will set the selection map
  to the new selection map great and I will copy the selection map I would go
  here here and yeah one thing I will make a function which would basically
  return the selected props if the button is selected so I&#39;ll say go on get
  selected selected button props is equal to is selected if is selected then let
  me give it a type so Boolean then return this otherwise return this for the
  selected case color scheme should be blue and variant should be solid so now I
  would say spread these props selection map and I will pass the ID so basically
  if a particular button is Select selected for that particular corresponding ID
  of the button selection map would return true if it is true then I am
  basically returning a color scheme blue and we install it so basically that
  button would become blue so now if I you know write something and I apply some
  format you can see that that particular button gets highlighted here and now
  even if I am you know typing something new because it is carrying the same
  format all the buttons are highlighted and you know if I let&#39;s say remove
  some format in apply some different kind of formatting then you will see that
  when I select this these buttons get selected but when when I select this text
  these buttons get highlighted or selected so basically that is how most rich
  text editors work now the last thing I need to add is the headings select so
  if I select a particular heading basically it should change the format of the
  text to that particular heading style so let&#39;s add that so for that I will
  add a select here so select from Chakra UI then basically there is a headings
  array I have already defined so this is H1 to H6 so headings. map heading I
  would return a option tag an HTML option tag here I will show The Heading and
  here the value would also be heading now inside the select I will add an on
  change function I&#39;ll say e update heading e. target. value so whatever
  option we click basically it would pass it to the update heading function let
  me create the update heading function so update heading is equal to it we
  would get the heading here and this heading would have a type so I will go
  here and I will import from legal this text I&#39;ll import two things first
  of all I will import the type so heading tag type and then create heading node
  cool now I will use this as the type here in this particular function now
  inside this function first of all I&#39;ll do the same thing as I did for the
  update toolbar case so I have to see if the selection is valid and get the
  selected text because I want to apply the heading format to the selected text
  so I&#39;ll add it here remove this here I will import another function so
  from legal selction I will import rap nodes now here I would say rap nodes
  I&#39;ll pass in the selection then a function and here I would say create
  heading node and heading let me pass the dollar sign here great here I would
  say as heading tag type to silent the types of eror it size is huge let me
  shrink the size I&#39;ll say size should be XS also let me give it a right
  margin of two great one last thing which I forgot I will have to wrap this
  with I do update so this would go here let me also pass a placeholder so Place
  holder is equal to select heading if I now add any text and I select any
  heading you&#39;ll see that that particular heading is applied which is great
  okay so we can see that we can apply different formattings by clicking on
  these buttons but normally that&#39;s not what people expect when using aex
  editor they expect that they would have key shortcuts like contrl Z for undo
  contrl B for bold Etc that is a better ux so let&#39;s add that so for that I
  will create a hook so let me create a hooks folder so I&#39;ll go here hooks
  then inside it I will create use key findings. TSX let me create the hook
  Bings is equal to and basically I will use the on action function which we
  have in the toolbar plugin and basically I&#39;ll will pass it as a prop to
  this component and basically based on the keys I press I basically would
  perform the necessary action so I will get the action here so on action and on
  action would have the type ID which text action cool now let me import it here
  so I I will place it here on key bindings and then I&#39;ll pass the on action
  function here great now here let me get the editor as always so I&#39;ll say
  import from lexical react composer context I will get the hook so use lexical
  composer context I will get the editor from here then let me use the use
  effect and basically I will do the same thing as I did in case of checking if
  I can undo or redo Etc I will register a event listener so I will say editor.
  register command and then the command name is key enter command so basically
  whenever some key would be pressed in this R text editor this event list now
  would draun cool so event now this this event would basically give me
  different stuff like also let me pass the priority so basically this event
  listem would give me different stuff like you know which keys I pressed did I
  press the control key Etc so I&#39;ll for example I say if event do key is
  equal to B and and event. control key so basically if I pressed controll and B
  then I should call on action function with the r Tex action do bold command
  let me pass on action and editor here cool now let me test it now if I type
  some text I select it and I click on control B you&#39;ll see that that button
  gets selected also it gets formatted to bold and I didn&#39;t even click on
  the button and you saw it so similarly I would like to add it for some more
  key bindings so if I type control and I I would like to make it italics if I
  type control and U I would like to underline it if I type contrl n z I would
  like to undo if I type contrl y I would like to redo so these are the things
  which I think are essential but if you want you can add your own key
  combinations and the respective actions here as well your choice now I can
  select this text I can click on control I it makes it italicized I can click
  on control U it underlines it similarly I can click on contrl Z and it undos
  it and I can click on control Y and basically redo it so that is how you can
  add key bindings to yourex editor now everything is great but this right now
  was an uncontrolled component what we want is we want to make this a
  controlled component so that first of all we can you know if there is a form I
  can integrate this R text editor in a form and then you know basically if I
  click on submit I can take the payload send it to the back end similarly if
  the payload for the is Tex edor the string is coming from the back end I can
  repopulate this is text editor so let me make it a controll component so for
  that let me go to Rich Text Editor and let me add some props here so I would
  go to the Rich Text Editor props let me copy this paste it here so first of
  all value would be string on change would be a function which expects value
  which is a string which would be a Setter for the state then let me have a
  placeholder so I&#39;m basically making this a usable component now and this
  would also be a string and here I would also have a name property so basically
  if there are multiple dist editors in a form I want that their name space is
  different so I&#39;ll copy this initial config and basically I&#39;ll put it
  here so initial config I&#39;ll WB this with use memo and basically let me
  import use memo here I would have value on change place folder name name would
  go here and here similarly placeholder would go here let me make a form
  component so I&#39;ll say new file form. ESX here I will have a box first of
  all let me import the this text editor here let me have a state here so const
  value set set value is equal to U State empty string on change would be set
  value new value so new value would come from here here it would be value is
  equal to value and name would be let&#39;s say post maybe this a blog post
  form and let me also add a placeholder here I&#39;ll say select post now here
  I will add a submission button also so its color scheme would be WhatsApp so
  basically green size would be access here I&#39;ll would say save for now and
  also let me give it a margin top of two that is good but I now have to
  basically add these value and on change somewhere so basically I will have to
  create a onchange plugin so let&#39;s create that and then I will add it here
  so I&#39;ll go here to plugins let me create a plugin so custom on change
  plugin. TSX I&#39;ll go here RFC now here let me basically have props so
  custom on change plug-in props and basically the props should be the same as
  for H text editor so value on change so I&#39;ll grab it I&#39;ll put it here
  and then value on change let me add this plugin in the r text editor so I will
  add it here so custom on change plugin value should go here on change should
  go here now let&#39;s add the logic for setting the state which is our first
  priority that is simple I will import the orang plugin so I&#39;ll say from
  legal react on change plug-in I want to import the on plugin here I would
  return it so onchange plugin inside onchange plugin I will add an on change
  function this on change function would give me the editor State I&#39;ll say
  editor state. read inside this read function I&#39;ll will call on change my
  function I would import another function from the package so I&#39;ll say from
  lexical HTML I will import generate HTML from nodes so generate HTML from
  nodes that expects an editor instance so I will have to import that as well so
  let me copy this so here I&#39;ll say laical composer context I&#39;ll import
  the hook here I&#39;ll say const editor same thing which I did previously and
  I&#39;ll call the hook and I&#39;ll pass the editor here let me add the dollar
  sign here great so basically now I haven&#39;t CED for the value but whenever
  I would type something this on change function would be called and the state
  would be updated so now you can see you know it works the same way let me
  console log the state so that we can know if it is working or not so I will
  say console log value now inside the app component in start of this text
  editor Let Me import the form component now you can see that you know I get
  some value here now every time I would type something you can see that I get
  some stringified HTML I you know bold it it alizes whatever it basically adds
  the necessary stylings and tags here like the B tag I tag U tag and this is a
  stringified HTML I can send it to the back end and it can be stored as a
  normal string and then basically I can retrieve it so basically now I&#39;ll
  add the logic for that where I can use the form to submit it and you know it
  would send this string to the back end and then basically I can retrieve the
  HTML on refresh and basically it would update the r text editor so let&#39;s
  add that so basically I already have created a small server so basically this
  is a normal Express server and I&#39;m not utilizing a database but basically
  there is a variable here so every time I would post the data so when I would
  click on the save button I would basically send the text here and every time I
  would do that I would basically replace this text with the new text I&#39;m
  sending from the front end and every time I would use the get method to get
  the data I would basically return the updated text so basically this can be
  seen as a server which is using a database and basically use storing the
  string in in a database but I didn&#39;t want to complicate things so that is
  our Demi server and also I have created a query and mutation beforehand
  because I didn&#39;t want to comp things so basically this is a mutation
  I&#39;ve created from T requery and I&#39;m calling this data mutation
  function post and basically I would just send in the text and it would be
  saved as the variable in the server here in the query I am basically just
  getting the data and returning it first of all let me integrate the mutation
  so I would go to the form component let me close all the files let me remove
  this here I would create an on Save function so on Save would be let me import
  the mutations so mutate a sync save text is equal to use update data and
  basically I would just I would pass in the value here and on click I would
  like to call this function and basically when the mutation would be called I
  would get a spending variable during the time so basically in order to know if
  the mutation is running I would change the text so if spending is true I would
  add saving otherwise save so let me open the network tab let me add something
  so you know whatever text let me add The Styling let me click save and now you
  can see that I&#39;m basically sending in this stringified HTML and I&#39;m
  getting a status true great now let me integrate the query as well to see if I
  get the updated data so I&#39;ll say cons data is equal to use data so now let
  me refresh this and the query is called and it returns meow basically the same
  text which we sent in the signified HTML form with bold and superscript and
  strike through Stelling so that is present here great now the only thing which
  which we need to do is we need to take this stringified HTML and basically
  show it in the r text editor so let&#39;s do that so let me go to the r text
  editor file here and the custom on change plug-in function is where we will
  add the remaining Logic for writing the query data here so I will have a state
  so const is first render set is first render is equal to U state so initially
  it would be true because it is the first lender then I will add a use effect
  let me add a bis I will add here if there is no value or or if it&#39;s not
  the first render then return I don&#39;t want to do anything here I would set
  is render to fults because now it&#39;s not you know I ins start the US effect
  here I again need the editor so I&#39;ll say editor do update let me add the
  dependencies here so editor value is first trender here I would need another
  function so just like I was generating HTML from nodes now I need generate
  nodes from Dom so first I would like to generate the HML current HTML from the
  editor just like I did here so I&#39;ll copy this if this current HTML is not
  equal to the value then I want to update the this Tex editor with the value I
  will get the get root function from lexical and I&#39;ll say clear then I will
  get the parser from Dom parser I would pass the string so I&#39;ll say cons do
  is equal to parser do parse from string value and the type would be text HTML
  so I will get the nodes then so generate nodes from Dom first I&#39;ll pass
  the editor instance and then the Dom and then I&#39;ll basically use the
  insert nodes function from lexical and insert the nodes now one last thing is
  remaining I will add use effect here so when the query data would come I would
  want to update the state with the query data so that let me add the data here
  I also need to add another use effect so if the value Ines then I want to set
  the is first render to true now if I refresh you will see that the data
  persists and the data coming from the back end is shown here which is great
  now if you know I add any other thing like you know I add this dummy text I
  basically make it coded I you know change it&#39;s text element Etc now if I
  save it and refresh it you will see that you know the data persists and the
  data is shown in the so that is it for the course I am pretty sure you liked
  it there was not enough material for it on YouTube and I was using it my in my
  job so I thought that I should make a video about it if you like the video
  learned anything from it please make sure to subscribe to the channel it took
  me a long while to make this course and also so it takes a long while to make
  the video plus edit it Etc so it would be great if you would you know show
  some support and you know like the video share it with your friends subscriber
  Etc so that is it for the video and I&#39;ll see you in the next video bye
